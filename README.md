Application description: 
"SisuSays" is a word play between the Finnish empowering term "sisu" and speaking-out as your democratic voice.

Our app reflects the vision of a real-time social-network feed of user-voted topics. Motivating citizens to take place in the stage of a real-time digital democracy discussion stage.

A verified scope - as comprehensive schools, universities or ministries can simply register online and create a scope. Through an one time unique link, users can identify and start their journey. Exploring all available political topics - voting on existing ones or proposing new arguments. An computed algorithm ensures equally distributed discussion-feeds.

Weâ€™re enhancing engagement through gamification, encouraging participation by adding fun, interactive elements to the process. Users can level-up, earn badges, reach milestones, and see their impact grow as they vote and share ideas.

The collected user-data can then be anonymously exported, to convince decision makers with unified groundbreaking ideas.
